# Examples

This folder contains examples. Their main purpose is to be living documentation. They are also e2e tests. You can find more examples in [e2e folder](../e2e/) but they test specific cases.

This folder is one big Nevalang module. Every test is a separate package in that module. To run single test, all other test must compile.
