## 🤔 What Is Nevalang?

Nevalang is a new kind of programming language where instead of writing step-by-step instructions you create **networks** where data flows between **nodes** as **immutable messages** and everything runs **in parallel by default**. After **type-checking**, your program is compiled into **machine code** and can be distributed as a **single executable** with zero dependencies.

Combined with built-in **stream processing** support and features like **advanced error handling**, Nevalang is the perfect choice for **cloud-native applications** requiring **high concurrency**.

Future updates will include **visual programming** and **Go interoperability** to allow gradual adoption and leverage existing ecosystem.

> ⚠️ This project is under active development and not yet production-ready.

## 👋 Hello, World!

```neva
import { fmt }

def Main(start any) (stop any) {
	println fmt.Println<string>
	---
	:start -> 'Hello, World!' -> println -> :stop
}
```

What’s happening here:

- `import { fmt }` loads the `fmt` package for printing
- `def Main` defines the main component with input port `start` and output port `stop` of type `any` (it's safe since it's only used as a signal)
- `:start -> 'Hello, World!' -> println -> :stop` defines a connection that sends the string to `println` when program starts and terminates after printing (runtime sends a message to `Main:start` at startup and waits for `Main:stop` to terminate)

## 🔥 Features

- **Dataflow Programming** - Write programs as message-passing graphs
- **Implicit Parallelism** - Everything is parallel by default, no async-await/threads/goroutines/etc.
- **Strong Static Typing** - Robust type system with generics and pattern-matching
- **Machine Code Compilation** - Compile for any Go-supported platform, including WASM
- **Stream Processing** - Handle real-time data with streams as first class citizens
- **Advanced Error Handling** - Errors as values with `?` operator to avoid boilerplate
- **Functional Patterns** - Immutability and higher-order components
- **Dependency Injection** - Modularity with interfaces and DI
- **Minimal Core** - Simple language with limited abstractions
- **Package Manager** - Publish packages by pushing a git-tag
- **Garbage Collection** - Automatic memory management using Go's low-latency GC
- **Visual Programming** (WIP): Edit programs as visual graphs
- **Go Interoperability** (WIP): Call Go from Neva and Neva from Go
- **NextGen Debugging** (WIP): Observe execution in realtime and intercept messages on the fly

## 🧐 Why Nevalang?

Let's compare Nevalang with Go. We could compare it to any language but Go is a simple reference since Nevalang is written in Go.

| **Feature**              | **Neva**                                                           | **Go**                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Paradigm**             | Dataflow - nodes send and receive messages through connections     | Control flow - execution moves through instructions step by step                  |
| **Concurrency**          | Implicit - everything is concurrent by default                     | Explicit - goroutines, channels, and mutexes                                      |
| **Error Handling**       | Errors as values with `?` operator to avoid boilerplate            | Errors as values with `if err != nil {}` boilerplate                              |
| **Mutability**           | Immutable - no variables and pointers; data races are not possible | Mutable - variables and pointers; programmer must avoid data races                |
| **Null Safety**          | Yes - nil pointer dereference is impossible                        | No - nil pointer dereference is possible                                          |
| **Zero Values**          | No zero values - everything must be explicitly initialized         | Zero values by default - everything can be initialized implicitly                 |
| **Subtyping**            | Structural - types are equal by their shape                        | Nominal - types are equal by their name                                           |
| **Traceback**            | Automatic - every message traces its path                          | Manual - programmer must explicitly wrap every error to add context               |
| **Dependency Injection** | Built-in - any component with dependency expects injection         | Manual - programmer must create constructor function that takes dependencies      |
| **Stream Processing**    | Native support with components like `Map/Filter/Reduce`            | Programmer must manually implement dataflow patterns with goroutines and channels |

Nevalang compiles to dependency-free, human-readable Go code that uses goroutines and channels for message-passing with parallelism. The Go compiler then produces optimized platform-specific code for any supported platform. This approach gives our programs access to Go's production-grade runtime with an advanced scheduler, garbage collector, and battle-tested standard library. We stand on the shoulders of giants.
