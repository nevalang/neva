# Neva

A general-purpose flow-based programming language with static types and implicit parallelism. Compiles to machine code and Go.

Website: https://nevalang.org/

## Quick Start

### Download Neva CLI

For Mac OS and Linux:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevalang/neva/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

if you device connected to China network:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevalang/neva/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

For Windows (please note there's an WIP [issue](https://github.com/nevalang/neva/issues/499) with Windows Defender, try manual download from releases if installed won't work):

```batch
curl -o installer.bat -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nevalang/neva/main/scripts/install.bat && installer.bat
```

### Create test project

```bash
neva new test
cd test
```

Replace the code in `src/main.neva` with the following:

```neva
component Main(start) (stop) {
	nodes { Println }
	net {
		:start -> ('Hello, World!' -> println -> :stop)
	}
}
```

Here we define _component_ `Main` with _inport_ `start` and _outport_ `stop`. It has 1 _node_ `println` that's an _instance_ of `Println` component. Then we define _network_ - set of connections that describe dataflow - when message from `start` received, a string literal "Hello, World!" is sent to node `println`. When that message is printed, program is terminated by sending to `stop`.

### Execute

Now run (make sure you are in created `test` directory with `neva.yml`):

```bash
neva run src
```

You should see the following output:

```bash
Hello, World!
```

### What's Next?

- [See more examples](./examples/)
- [Learn how to generate native code, Go or other targets](https://nevalang.org/docs/quick-start)
- [Learn more about the language](https://nevalang.org/docs/about)

## Features 🚀

- Flow-Based Programming
- Implicit Parallelism
- Strong Static Typing
- Multi-Target Compilation
- Clean C-like Syntax
- Interpreter Mode
- Builtin Dependency Injection
- Builtin Observability
- Package Management
- Garbage Collection

Please note that even though these features are technically implemented, **developer-experience may be bad** due to current project state. **No backward-compatibility** guarantees at the time.

## Roadmap (🚧 WIP)

Nevalang is at an extremely early stage but with the help of community it can become a feature-rich, mature language.

- Building a Community
- Core Standard Library
- Feature-Rich LSP-compatible Language Server
- Go Interop (import go from neva and neva from go)
- DAP-compatible Debugger
- Testing Framework
- No Runtime Exceptions (If it runs then it works)
- Visual Programming in VSCode (Nevalang becomes hybrid langauge)

[See backlog for more details](https://github.com/orgs/nevalang/projects)

Nevalang needs your help - it currently just a few maintainers.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

Neva is a relatively small and simple language. Don't be intimidated, feel free to dive in and hack around. Some directories have a `README.md`.

Note that, due to the early stage of development, the documentation can sometimes be outdated. Feel free to reach maintainers if you need _any_ help.
