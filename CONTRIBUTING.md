# Requirements

First make sure you have solid understanding of Nevalang from user perspective. After you understood the language API install these dependencies:

## System

- Go: https://go.dev/doc/install
- Make: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download
- NodeJS and NPM: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm/
- Antlr: `pip install antlr4-tools`
- Tygo: `go install github.com/gzuidhof/tygo@latest`

## VSCode Extensions

These are not really required but recommended in order you're using VSCode

- [nevalang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nevalang.vscode-nevalang)
- [antlr4](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mike-lischke.vscode-antlr4)
- [tmlanguage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pedro-w.tmlanguage)
- [markdown-mermaid](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid)

# Development

Have a look at [architecture](./ARCHITECTURE.md) and [makefile](./Makefile) can do.

## VSCode Extension

Check out [tygo.yaml](./tygo.yaml) and make sure you didn't broke TS generation. Then clone [vscode-neva](https://github.com/nevalang/vscode-neva) and read `CONTRIBUTING.md` there

## ANTLR Grammar

Don't forget to open `neva.g4` file before debugging with VSCode. After you make changes to grammar, run parser's smoke tests. Use debug tasks in `.vscode` to inspect possible issues. If you encounter complex issue write real unit test first.

# Naming conventions

## Tests

Use `_` instead of space in for test-case names because go turns spaces into underscores and makes it hard to find specific case.

# Q&A

This is list of questions about internal implementation you may be asking

## Why structures are not represented as Go structures?

It would take generating Go types dynamically which is either makes use of reflection or codegeneration (which makes interpreter mode impossible). Maps have their overhead but they are easy to work with.

## Why nested structures are not represented as flat maps?

Indeed it's possible to represent `{ foo {bar int } }` like `{ "foo/bar": 42 }`. The problem arise when when we access the whole field. Let's take this example:

```
types {
    User {
        pet {
            name str
        }
    }
}

...

$u.pet -> foo.bar
```

What will `foo.bar` actually receive? This design makes impossible to actually send structures around and allows to operate on non-structured data only.

## Why Go?

It's a perfect match. Go has builtin green threads, scheduler and garbage collector. Even more than that - it has goroutines and channels that are 1-1 mappings to FBP's ports and connections. Last but not least is that it's a pretty fast compiled language. Having Go as a compile target allows to reuse its state of the art standart library and increase performance for free by just updating the underlaying compiler.

## Why compiler operates on multi-module graph (build) and not just turns everything into one big module?

Imagine you have `foo.bar` in your code. How does compiler figures out what that actually is? In order to do that it needs to _resolve_ that _reference_. And this is how _reference resolution_ works:

First, find out what `foo` is. Look at the `import` section in the current file. Let's say we see something like:

```neva
import {
    github.com/nevalang/x/foo
}
```

This is how we now that `foo` is actually `github.com/nevalang/x/foo` imported package. Cool, but when version of the `github.com/nevalang/x` we should use? Well, to figure that out we need to look out current _module_'s _manifest_ file. There we can find something like:

```yaml
deps:
  - github.com/nevalang/x 0.0.1
```

Cool, now we now what _exactly_ `foo` is. It's a `foo` package inside of `0.0.1` version of the `github.com/nevalang/x` module. So what's the point of operating on a nested multi-module graph instead of having one giant module?

Now let's consider another example. Instead of depending on `github.com/nevalang/x` your code depends on `submodule` and that sub-module itself depends on `github.com/nevalang/x`

You still have that `foo.bar` in your code and your module still depends on `github.com/nevalang/x` module. But now you also depends on another `submod` sub-module that also depends on `github.com/nevalang/x`. But your module depends on `github.com/nevalang/x` of the `0.0.1` version and `submod` depends on `1.0.0`.

Now we have a problem. When compiler sees `foo.bar` in some file it does import lookup and sees `github.com/nevalang/x` and... does not know what to do. To solve this issue we need to lookup current module manifest and check what version `github.com/nevalang/x` _this current module_ uses. To do that we need to preserve the multi-module structure of the program.

One might ask can't we simply import things like:

```neva
import {
    github.com/nevalang/x@0.0.1
}
```

That actually could solve the issue. The problem is that now we have to update the source code _each time we update our dependency_. That's a bad solution. We simply made probramming harder to avoid working on a compiler. We can do better.

## Why #runtime_func_msg does not accept literals?

Indeed it would be handy to be able to do stuff like this:

```neva
nodes {
    #runtime_func_msg(str "hello world!")
    const Const<str>
}
```

This would make desugarer much simpler (no need to create all this virtual constants), and not just for const senders but for struct selectors too.

However, to implement this we need to be able to parse literals inside `irgen`. Right now we already introduce dependency for parsing entity references, but for arbitrary expressions we need the whole parser.

Of course, it's possible to hide actual parser implementation behind some kind of interface defined by irgen but that would make code more complicated. Besides, the very idea of having parser inside code-generator sounds bad. Parsing references is the acceptable compromise on the other hand.

## Why Analyzer knows about stdlib? Isn't it bad design?

At first there was a try to implement analyzer in a way that it only knows about the core of the language.

But turns out that some components in stdlib (especially `builtin` package, especially the ones that uses `#runtime_func` and `#runtime_func_msg` directives) are actually part of the core of the language.

E.g. when user uses struct selectors like `foo.bar/baz -> ...` and then desugarer replaces this with `foo.bar -> structSelectorNode("baz") -> ...` (this is pseudocode) we must ensure that type of the `bar` is 1) a `struct` 2) has field `baz` and 3) `baz` is compatible with whatever `...` is. _This is static semantic analysis_ and that's is work for analyzer.

Actually every time we use compiler directive we depend on implicit contract that cannot be expressed in the terms of the language itself (except we introduce abstractions for that, which will make language more complicated). That's why we have to analyze such things by injecting knowledge about stdlib.

Designing the language in a way where analyzer has zero knowledge about stdlib is possible in theory but would make the language more complicated and would take much more time.

## Why desugarer comes after analyzer in compiler's pipeline?

Two reasons:

1. Analyzer should operate on original "sugared" program so it can found errors in user's source code. Otherwise found errors can relate to desugar implementation (compiler internals) which is not the compilation error but debug info for compiler developers. Finally it's much easier to make end-user errors readable and user-friendly this way.
2. Desugarer that comes before analysis must duplicate some validation because it's unsafe to desugar some constructs before ensuring they are valid. E.g. desugar struct selectors without knowing fir sure that outport's type is a valid structure. Also many desugaring transformations are only possible on analyzed program with all type expressions resolved.

Actually it's impossible to have desugarer before analysis. It's possible to have two desugarers - one before and one after. But that would make compiler much more complicated without visible benefits.
